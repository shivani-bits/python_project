📊 Python Data Analysis Project

🔍 Project Overview

This project dives deep into fitness and activity data, leveraging Python for insightful analysis and advanced visualizations. The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations to better understand user behavior and highlight actionable insights for improving fitness.

By utilizing diverse datasets, we’ve analyzed activity levels, calorie burn patterns, and step distributions, offering a data-driven approach to enhancing physical activity routines.

📂 Datasets daily_activity_clean.csv: Contains the enitre data of user track and their activities progress. percentage.csv: Contains percentage distributions of activity levels (very active, fairly active, lightly active, sedentary). percentage2.csv: Provides time spent (in minutes) in different activity levels. percentage3.csv: Adds cumulative statistics and positional values for activity levels. week_calories_df.csv: Tracks calories burned across days of the week. week_steps_df.csv: Logs total steps taken for each day of the week.

✨ Key Features Comprehensive Analysis: Cleaned, merged, and analyzed datasets to ensure accuracy and relevance. Diverse Visualizations: Pie charts, line plots, and bar graphs for easy data interpretation. Correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between variables.

Actionable Insights: Highlighted sedentary behavior dominance and areas for potential improvement. Established correlations between steps taken and calories burned. Identified activity trends across days of the week.

🛠 Technologies Used Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, joypy Notebook Environment: Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis.
